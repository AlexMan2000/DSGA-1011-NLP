## Project Proposal Submission Instruction
Please read the instruction carefully and follow the steps to ensure a complete submission. 

Errorneous submission 
(eg., multiple submissions per group, missing team members, missing team response, missing project submission) may 
result in point deduction or grading error.

---

1. Submit **project signup form** [here](https://forms.gle/CupmzExTrqNetbs8A). Each team should only submit **one** response.
   (For example, Ana, Bob and Carly are in a group and Ana is the only one who submits the form for the whole team.)

   We will assign team ids based on submission time
   and assign project mentors based on your title. You should have between 1-5 members and a clear project title.
   Please make sure you fill in the **name and netid** for **all** team members.

   Upon successful submission, you will receive an email of your own response.
   If you need to change the response, you can go back to the form and edit before the submission deadline.

3. **Download the project** proposal latex template. You can open the zip file using overleaf or other latex editor.
   Please complete your project proposal based on the provided template. 

4. Submit the proposal on Gradescope.
  You should submit the pdf compiled using latex **as a group**. 
  Following the previous example, suppose Bob is responsible for proposal submission, then Ana and Carly **should not re-submit**.

That's all, congrats on finishing proposal submission!
